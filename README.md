# Graduation-Project
- Product for Alzheimer Patients (Graduation Project) 
We are developing on Android; a product that we want to put some of our games and applications. According to the information we receive from these applications, we will try to determine the patient's condition and make inferences. We will focus on Data Mining and Machine Learning with the data we collect. Using Firebase as a database, we will be able to connect to the same database from different environments. The languages we use; Android (Java / XML), Python, HTML5 / CSS (for admin panel).
